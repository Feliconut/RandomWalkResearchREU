# Project Log

## 2022-09-12

Tasks due before next meeting:

- [ ] (possibly) vectorize the path generating code, make it faster
- [ ] Learn about K-S test and Chi-squared test, and implement in the code
- [ ] Tune the experiment parameters (trial length, number of trials) and look for trends
- [ ] Read about Brownian Motion and understand its defining properties
- [ ] Design tests to determine if the data is Brownian Motion
- [ ] Implement these tests and apply to SSRW
